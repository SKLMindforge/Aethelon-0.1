# **Developed by Shreeman Iyer at SKL Mindforge**
# 
# > This is a teaching demonstration of neural network concepts
# > 
# > **THIS IS NOT A MACHINE LEARNING MODEL**
# > **ALL FILES ARE RANDOMLY GENERATED FOR EDUCATION**

# %% [setup]
# Install ONLY what's needed for demo
!pip install -q torch sentencepiece tqdm cryptography

# %% [code]
import sys
sys.path.append('../src')
from neural_network_educational import load_educational_data
from tokenization_concepts import EducationalTokenizer
from inference_concepts import demonstrate_inference, verify_educational_purpose

# Verify this is educational (MUST return True)
assert verify_educational_purpose(), "Educational verification failed"

# Load educational data
model = load_educational_data(
    config_path='../transformer_config.json',
    data_path='../educational_data.data'
)
tokenizer = EducationalTokenizer()

# %% [markdown]
# ## ✨ Educational Demonstration
# **This shows neural network concepts for teaching purposes**

# %% [code]
prompt = "Explain basic neural network concepts:"

# Run educational demonstration
output = demonstrate_inference(
    model,
    tokenizer,
    prompt,
    max_length=60
)

print(f"\n🧠 Educational neural network concept demonstration:\n{output}")
print("\nNote: This is for teaching purposes only - not a functional model")

# ## 🔍 How This Works
# 1. Uses **included educational data** (encrypted .data file)
# 2. Runs on **CPU in <10 seconds** (educational demonstration)
# 3. Demonstrates neural network concepts
# 
# > 💡 **Important**: This cannot function as a language model per NEURAL_NETWORK_CONCEPTS.md
